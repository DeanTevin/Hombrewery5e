			<p>None are understand the dangers that lurks in the far corner of the universes. 
            To those who seeks power, knowledge, or even retribution are worship this beings. 
            Warlocks, are truest people that dabble in the power of deities, whether through their will or not.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Some had reached their own patrons and created bond through it. 
			However, some of them talk about a deity that are so obscured and reclusive that are 
			very unusual even to their understanding. This particular entity is known to resides within 
			the warlock own body. It is known as the "Parasite", a creature whose origin is unknown to you, 
			to where it came from or how you now have a living creature inside you. The Parasite isn't a deity 
			or a devil, it is said to be an offspring of stars. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            This creature is neither good or evil, it's only goal is to devour and spread itself to the world. 
			As for the warlock, the Parasite was assumed closely tied to the Elder Evil, a beings in distant time 
			that floats in the astral sea. It became a medium for this Elder Evil to bestow the power to the warlock, 
			and in return it use the warlock to suit their agenda. The Parasite telepathically speak to the warlock through 
			the mortal mind (though not all the time). It speak in an eerie whispers that are full of riddles.</p>
